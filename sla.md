# Service Level Agreement

1. <span class="header_2">Uptime</span>

    1. <span class="header_3">Target Uptime.</span>  If there is a <span class="orderform_link">Target Uptime</span>, <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Cloud Service available for at least the <span class="orderform_link">Target Uptime</span> as calculated each calendar month.

    2. <span class="header_3">Calculating Uptime.</span>  <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> and <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> agree to calculate availability of the Cloud Service as the total number of Available Minutes minus the number of Downtime Minutes, divided by the total number of Available Minutes, measured in a calendar month. If the <span class="orderform_link">Subscription Period</span> includes a partial month, the numerator and denominator will only include the days that are part of the <span class="orderform_link">Subscription Period</span> for that month.

2. <span class="header_2">Response Time</span>

    1. <span class="header_3">Target Response Time.</span> If there is a <span class="orderform_link">Target Response Time</span>, <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> will use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to support requests sent to the <span class="orderform_link">Support Channel</span> within the <span class="orderform_link">Target Response Time</span>.

    2. <span class="header_3">Calculating Response Time.</span>  <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> and <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> agree to calculate <span class="coverpage_link">Provider’s</span> response time as the total time between when <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> submits a support request to the <span class="orderform_link">Support Channel</span> and when <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> or <span class="coverpage_link">Provider’s</span> support representative specifically acknowledges the request. An automated response is not a specific acknowledgement for purposes of this SLA.

3. <span class="header_2">Remedies</span>

    1. <span class="header_3">Service Credit.</span>  If there is a <span class="orderform_link">Target Uptime</span> and Cloud Service availability falls below the <span class="orderform_link">Target Uptime</span>, <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> is eligible to receive an <span class="orderform_link">Uptime Credit</span>. If there is a <span class="orderform_link">Target Response Time</span> and neither <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> nor <span class="coverpage_link">Provider’s</span> support representative acknowledge a support request submitted to the <span class="orderform_link">Support Channel</span> within the <span class="orderform_link">Target Response Time</span>, <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> is eligible to receive a <span class="orderform_link">Response Time Credit</span>. Service Credits only apply towards future Cloud Service Fees owed by <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> to <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span>.

    2. <span class="header_3">Requesting A Service Credit.</span>  To receive a Service Credit, <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> must notify <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> within 7 days of the end of the month in which <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> believes the Service Credit was earned, otherwise Service Credit eligibility will expire for that month.

        a. For <span class="orderform_link">Uptime Credit</span>, <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> must include information about when it was unable to access the Cloud Service. <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> may be required to provide additional details about its attempts to access the Cloud Service. If <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> can verify Cloud Service unavailability in its internal monitoring systems and the disruption does not qualify as Excluded Minutes or <span class="orderform_link">Scheduled Downtime</span>, <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> will calculate and issue the applicable <span class="orderform_link">Uptime Credit</span> on <span class="coverpage_link">Customer’s</span> account to apply towards a future invoice.

        a. For <span class="orderform_link">Response Time Credit</span>, <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> must include information about when and how <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> contacted <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span>. <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> may be required to provide additional details about the related incident and its attempts to receive support. If <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> can verify neither <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> nor <span class="coverpage_link">Provider’s</span> support representative responded to <span class="coverpage_link">Customer’s</span> support request within the <span class="orderform_link">Target Response Time</span>, <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> will calculate and issue the applicable <span class="orderform_link">Response Time Credit</span> on <span class="coverpage_link">Customer’s</span> account to apply towards a future invoice.

    3. <span class="header_3">Service Credit Limitations.</span>  Service Credits may not be exchanged for, or converted to, monetary amounts. Service Credits do not earn interest. Service Credits will not accumulate within a single <span class="orderform_link">Subscription Period</span> in an amount more than 8% of Cloud Service Fees for that <span class="orderform_link">Subscription Period</span>. Service Credits expire when the applicable Order Form ends.

    4. <span class="header_3">Termination.</span>  If the Cloud Service does not meet the <span class="orderform_link">Target Uptime</span> for two (2) out of any three (3) consecutive months and <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> notified <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> of the failures within 7 days of the end of each impacted month, <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> may immediately terminate the affected Order Form by giving written notice to <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span>. If <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> terminates an Order Form under this section, <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> will pay to <span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> a prorated refund of prepaid fees for the remainder of the <span class="orderform_link">Subscription Period</span>.

    5. <span class="header_3">Exclusive Remedy.</span>  This SLA describes <span class="coverpage_link">Customer’s</span> exclusive remedy and <span class="coverpage_link">Provider’s</span> entire liability for any failure of the Cloud Service to meet the <span class="orderform_link">Target Uptime</span> and for any inability to meet the <span class="orderform_link">Target Response Time</span>.
