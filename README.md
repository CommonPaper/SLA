# Service Level Agreement

### How was this agreement created?
The Common Paper SLA was created by a committee of over 40 attorneys representing technology vendors, procurement teams, boutique firms, and Big Law.

### I see this agreement is hosted online. Does that mean it will change?
Version 1 of this agreement will remain unchanged and hosted on [this page forever](https://commonpaper.com/standards/service-level-agreement/1.0). Over time, we will create new versions to accommodate changes to the law and additional use cases. We expect future changes to occur infrequently, and they will always be posted as a new version.

### How do I use this agreement?
The Common Paper SLA is designed to be used with the Common Paper Cloud Service Agreement (CSA), an easy agreement for selling and buying cloud software and SaaS products. To execute a CSA, first download a copy of the Cover Page in your preferred format. Then fill out the business terms of your agreement, like subscription period and your SLA terms, and the legal terms like the governing law of your contract. Finally, sign your Cover Page with your counterparty via the signing process of your choice. The Cover Page incorporates the CSA Standard Terms and SLA Standard Terms by reference, completing the executed agreement.
